						<h3>Model Programs</h3>
						<p>This section contains detailed documentation and descriptions of successful D.A.T.E. programs. It is broken down by basic geographic type: urban, suburban, and rural. Here you will find excerpts from schools' actual D.A.T.E. applications as well as other supporting documentation.</p>
						<div class="accordion">
							<h4><a href="#">Urban</a></h4>
							<div>
								<h3 class="bigtext">Urban District A</h3>
								<p><span class="strong">District Profile: </span>District A is a large urban district in Region 11  with enrollment of over 80,000 student. It is 25% African American, 60%  Hispanic, and 2% Asian, and 13% white. Seventy-five percent of the district is  economically disadvantaged and it is 29% LEP. For the 2009-2010 school year, it  was rated academically acceptable.</p>
								<p><span class="strong">Plan Overview: </span>District A has utilized  D.A.T.E. as a means of restructuring underperforming campuses and has made a  commitment to supplement grant funds with local money. D.A.T.E. funds went to  campuses with the greatest need and they were redesigned around collaboration.The plan entirely rewards group performance at  the grade, department, and campus level.The district used the D.A.T.E. grant to introduce value-added modeling  into the school and part of the grant went to go towards improving data capacity. It also rewards principals, assistant principals, and instructional specialists for campus performance. </p>
								<p>Urban District A's D.A.T.E. plan meets all of the five identified criteria of a model plan:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span class="strong">Targeted </span>District A had a very tight focus, using D.A.T.E. funds to improve specific campuses that were most in need.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Meaningful Award Amounts</span> Teachers in some of District A's campuses can earn over $7,000 for improving student performance, which puts it among the highest award totals in the state.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Group Award Structures</span> District A deliberately supports collaboration by rewarding group performance by grade level, department, and the campus level. </li>
										<li><span class="strong">Includes Principals </span>District A's plan provides rewards for principals, assistant principals, and instructional specialists based on campus performance.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Includes Support Structures</span> District A's program provides money for professional development and data anlaysis.</li>
									</ul>
								<p><a href="docs/Models/Urban District A.pdf">Urban District A D.A.T.E. Application</a></p>
								<h3 class="bigtext">Urban District B</h3>
								<p><span class="strong">District Profile:</span> District B is a large district with enrollment over 50,000 students. For the  2009-2010 school year,&nbsp; the district was  rated as recognized. It is 11% African American, 19% Hispanic, and 21% Asian,  and 49% White. Approximately 24% of the district population is economically  disadvantaged and 12% is LEP. </p>
								<p><span class="strong">Plan Overview: </span>This plan targets campuses that are either underperforming the rest of the district or have higher percentages of economically disadvantaged students. It uses a district created  metric that rewards teachers at either the grade or departmetn level for student growth that exceeds the district average in a given subject. Growth is based on the Measure of Academic Progress (MAP) test, which has been used in the district for several years. Part II rewards non-core teachers, instructional specialists and other administrators for improving campus performance. In District A all teachers have after school tutoring responsibiltiies, regardless of content area.</p>
								<p>Urban District B's D.A.T.E. plan meets the following criteria of excellence:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span class="strong">Targeted </span>While District B is a recognized district overall, it uses its D.A.T.E. plan to focus on Blower performing campuses or campuses with a high percentage of economically disadvantaged students.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Meaningful Award Amounts </span>Teachers can earn nearly $2,000 under this plan, which has proven to be a significant amount of money to personnel within the district who have earned the award.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Group Award Structures</span> All the awards in the plan are at the grade, department, or campus level. This fits in with a campus culture in which every staff member has direct responsibility for improving student achievement.</li>
									</ul>

							<h4><a href="#">Suburban</a></h4>
							<div>
							<h3 class="bigtext">Suburban District A</h3>
								<p><span class="strong">District Profile:</span> Suburban District A is a medium sized district with enrollment over 20,000. It is 28%  African American, 74% Hispanic, and 6% White. Approximately 28% of the district  is LEP and 77% of the district is economically disadvantaged. For the 2009-2010  school year it was rated academically acceptable.</p>
								<p><span class="strong">Plan Overview:</span> District A targets math and science achievement  in Grades 5-12. Teachers are rewarded at the departmental level for student performance on TAKS. The plan also provides Part II awards for principals and other instructional specialists as well as recruitment and retention stipends for math and science teachers. </p>
								<p>More specifically, Suburban District A's plan meets the following criteria:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span class="strong">Targeted</span> The program does not target campuses, but it does have a tight focus on math and science. Every element of the plan rewards campus efforts to improve student achievement in math and science.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Group Award Structure </span>The plan rewards performance based on department level performance, indicative of a team-oriented structure in District A.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Meaningful Award Amounts </span>Teachers in District A can earn over $3,000 between Part I and Part II incentives, which exceeds the commonly accepted threshold for significant award amounts.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Includes Principals</span> District A's plan provides Part II awards for principals, assistant principals, and instructional specialists who work in math and science.</li>
									</ul>
								<p><a href="docs/Models/Suburban District A.pdf">Suburban District A D.A.T.E. Application</a></p>
								<h3 class="bigtext">Suburban District B</h3>
								<p><span class="strong">District Profile: </span>Suburban District  B  is a medium sized district in region x with enrollment of approximately  13,000 students. It is 43% African American, 45% Hispanic, and 9% White. Seventy  percent of the students were classified as economically disadvantaged and 13%  LEP. For the 2009-2010 school year, it was rated academically acceptable. </p>
								<p><span class="strong">Plan Overview: </span>District B has one of the most creative D.A.T.E. programs  aimed at improving student achievement along several parameters.Teachers at each grade level earn points based on year-over-year growth in overall student performance and the performance of economically disadvantaged students. There are rewards for both individual and group performance. Part II provides a range of opportunties for teachers and administrators to earn awards including participating in lesson design sessions, structured walk-throughs, and participating in data analysis meetings. </p>
								<p>Specifially, Suburban District B's plan meets the following criteria:</p>
								<ul><li><span class="strong">Group Award Structure </span>District B has   a hybrid structure that rewards not only individual and group performance. It also utilizes multiple measures of student growth that can increase the  perceived fairness of the measure.</p>
								<li><span class="strong">Includes Principals </span>The plan incorporates principals,  assistant principals, and instructional specialists. Not only does it reward  them for improving student achievement, but the plan directs them in specific  ways to help assist teachers by making collegial walk-throughs and professional  development on lesson plan design protocol a part of their incentives.</li>
								<li><span class="strong">Includes Support Structures </span>Part II of the plan rewards a series of practices aimed at improving instruction including lesson plan design protocols, collaborative data analysis and unit plan design sessions, and after school teacher discussion groups.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><span class="strong">N.B</span>. The complexity of this plan necessitated leaving the  plan in its original paper format as submitted to TEA rather than converting it  to an e-grants model. For help in utilizing this plan as part of a D.A.T.E. application,  please contact Technical Assistance.</p>

							<h4><a href="#">Rural</a></h4>
							<div>
								<h3 class="bigtext">Rural District A</h3>
								<p><span class="strong">District Profile: </span>Rural District  A  is a small, rural district in Region 8 with enrollment of just under 700  students. It is 2% African American, 14% Hispanic, and 84% White.&nbsp; It is 4% LEP and 50% of the students are  considered economically disadvantaged. For the 2009-2010 school year, is was a  recognized district.</p>
								<p><span class="strong">Plan Overview:</span> Small districts tend to have a more difficult time  excluding teachers from a D.A.T.E. grant in order to target areas of need. District A focused their award on TAKS-tested areas and came to an agreement with a teacher-led D.A.T.E. committee that this would be their districts approach. In terms of the criteria, this plan meets the following areas of excellence:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span class="strong">Targeted Plan</span> While it did not exclude campuses, the tight focus on TAKS meant that the district was looking to put its resources into where it was most needed</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Group Award Structure</span> Most of the plan rewards individual performance, but at the high school, District B created &quot;teams of two&quot; in math and science to support collaboration. They are rewarded based on performance on the exit test.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Includes Instructional Supports </span>District B used grant funds to support professional development in data analysis as well as expand data capabilities through the purchase of a data dashboard.</li>
									</ul>
								<p><a href="docs/Models/Rural District A.pdf">Rural District A D.A.T.E. Application</a></p>
								<h3 class="bigtext">Rural District B</h3>
								<p><span class="strong">District Profile</span>: Rural District B is an extremely small district in the Rio Grande Valley. It is 99% Hispanic, 90% economically  disadvantaged and 31% LEP. For 2010, the district was rated academically  acceptable. </p>
								<p><span class="strong">Plan Overview: </span>District B  used its D.A.T.E. plan to focus on math and  science achievement, which is an area of need for the district. It used  improvement from October to February on local benchmark assessments in order to  measure student performance and reward teachers. The plan also included  recruitment and retention stipends for teachers in these subject areas and  funds for professional development to improve instructional strategies and  teacher capacity for working with data.  Specifically, this D.A.T.E. plan meets the following areas  of excellence in program design:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span class="strong">Targeted  Plan: </span>While B did not target specific campuses, the D.A.T.E. plan  had a tight focus on math and science improvement and only included these  teachers. This is particularly notable because small districts tend to have  difficulty excluding teachers.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Group Awards:</span> District B rewarded both individual and team performance.  Teachers received an individual award based on the individual improvement of  their students and could receive a group award based on the improvement of all  the students targeted on a campus for a given subject. This is important  because it offers an incentive to collaborate which is a hallmark of small  districts.</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Meaningful  Awards:</span> All teachers included in this plan were eligible for $2,416 between  Part I and Part II. District B  pays its teachers the state minimum, so this  total was particularly meaningful</li>
										<li><span class="strong">Includes Instructional Supports: </span>This  plan  shows evidence of strategic thinking by targeting two subject areas and also  using funds to pay to professionally develop teachers in these areas. D.A.T.E.  money supplemented the professional development and data capacity funds that  B was already placing into math and science improvement to make this a  comprehensive district effort.</li>

					<p><span class="strong">This database was not designed to be a comprehensive list of award measures.  They are not meant to stand alone and do not represent an all-inclusive performance award program.</span></p>
					<p><span class="strong">Districts should consider the following when designing D.A.T.E. performance measures:</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Customize your program to meet particular student achievement needs.</li>
							<li>Consider how you will track and monitor performance measures over the course of the school year.</li>
							<li>Consider your district's data capacity and what your district data systems can measure.</li>
							<li>Consider your grant funding levels.</li>
							<li>Consider current achievement levels, achievement trends, and district goals when crafting performance measures. Since each district's program goals and current levels will vary, specific targets and awards amounts  were omitted from the sample measures.</li>

						<h4><a href="#cont_top">Contingency</a></h4>
						<div>
						<h3><a name="cont_top" id="cont_top"></a>Performance Measures: Contingency Plans</p></h3>
							<p>The contingency plan is one of the most overlooked aspects of a D.A.T.E. application. A poorly designed contingency plan can result in payouts that do not support program goals. A good contingency plan reflects the purpose and the structure of the main program design.</p>
						    <p>This section of our database addresses the common mistakes made in past plans and offers suggestions on how to avoid them. Each button below contains a common mistake made in a contingency plan and will take you to a solution and sample language for writing a contingency plan that avoids it. <span class="strong">We recommend taking time to look at each of these examples.</span></p>
						    <span class="strong">Note:</span>
						    <p><span class="strong">These contingency suggestions are for Cycle 1 districts only.</span> For Cycle 2, contingency plans are restricted. In Part I, districts may only transfer funds to Part II in excess of 60% of the grant. Any funds under 60% must remain unexpended. In Part II, there are a list of prescribed contingency uses, such as professional development and mentor teacher stipends, but they may not be used for incentive payments.</p>
						    <p><span class="strong"><a href="#cont_a">Mistake: </a></span><a href="#cont_a">Equally redistributing Part I or Part II funds without restricting the maximum award amount earned by a given teacher or staff member.</a></p>
						    <p><span class="strong"><a href="#cont_b">Mistake: </a></span><a href="#cont_b">Redistributing Part I or Part II funds without respect to the proportion in which the funds were originally allocated in the grant.</a></p>
						    <p><span class="strong"><a href="#cont_partii">Mistake: </a></span><a href="#cont_partii">Part II funds that merely redistribute funds among those who earned an award in Part II.</a></p>
						
						    <p><span class="strong"><a name="cont_a" id="cont_a">Mistake: </a>Equally redistributing Part I or Part II funds without restricting the maximum award amount earned by a given teacher or staff member.</span></p>
						    <p><span class="strong">Solution: Cap your Award.</span></p>
						    <p><span>Explanation</span>: Reallocating funds without a cap can create the possibility that a handful of teachers will receive the bulk of the funds. For example, suppose that only two teachers earned their maximum award of $1,000 among a group of 30 teachers. This leaves $28,000 left unspent. These two teachers, with equal redistribution of leftover funds, will receive payouts of $15,000. Such wide imbalances, especially if certain categories of teachers were excluded from the plan altogether, can cause great dissension and make the program seem unfair. <span class="strong">Sample Language:</span></p>
						    <p><span class="strong">Each of these models contains a cap. A cap is often insufficient to ensure a fair distribution.</span></p>
						    
						    <div class="padding10left padding10top">
						    	<p><span class="strong">Part I:</span>All remaining and undistributed Part I funds will be equally redistributed amongst teachers who earned a Part I award. The maximum award amount for a given teacher with redistribution for Part I is $_,000.00.</p>
						    	<p><span class="strong">Part II:</span>All remaining and undistributed Part II funds will be equally redistributed amongst staff who earned a Part II award. The maximum award amount for a given staff member with redistribution for Part II is $__,000. If all staff members reach their cap, Part II funds not redistributed will be applied to professional development and to pay substitute teachers in order to release teachers to attend professional development.</p>
						    </div>
						
						<div class="navtable"><a href="#cont_top">Return to Top of Page</a></div>
						
						    <p><span class="strong"><a name="cont_b" id="cont_b"></a></span><span class="strong">Mistake: Redistributing Part I or Part II funds without respect to the proportion in which the funds were originally allocated in the grant.</span></p>
						    <p><span class="strong">Solution: Differentiate your contingency plan awards in proportion to the way awards are split up in the main part of the grant.</span></p>
						    <p><span>Explanation</span>: It is important that the differentiated measures in your program— by achievement level, subject area, grade level, teams, etc.— are reflected in your contingency.</p>
						    <p>For example, suppose your Part I awards are tiered in the following manner:</p>
													<table class="performancemeasurestable">
						    <tr>
						    	<td><p>Level 1: $3,000</p></td>
						    	<td>11% or greater improvement on TAKS</td>
						    </tr>
						    <tr>
						    	<td><p>Level 2: $2,000</p></td>
						    	<td>6-10% improvement on TAKS</td>
						    </tr>
						    <tr>
						    	<td><p>Level 3: $1,000</p></td>
						    	<td>1-5% improvement on TAKS</td>
						    </tr>
						</table>
						
						    <p>One teacher earned a Level 1 award of $3,000 for raising TAKS scores by 12%--a great year—and another teacher earned a Level 3 award of $1,000 for raising TAKS scores by 2%. The contingency plan redistributed funds equally among all teachers who received an award up to $6,000. If enough teachers do not earn any award, and your awards are capped at $6,000, it is possible that both teachers could receive the same $6,000 but for vastly different results.</p>
						    <p><span class="strong">Sample Language:</span> <span class="strong"><span>Each of these models differentiates the contingency awards.</span></span></p>
						    <ul>
						    	<li><span class="strong"><a href="#cont_levels">For Part I award plan with levels based on performance</a></span></li>
						    	<li><span class="strong"><a href="#cont_group">For Part I award plan that contains group and individual awards</a></span></li>
						    	<li><span class="strong"><a href="#cont_team">For Part II award plan that combines tutoring and team teaching</a></span></li>
						    </ul>
						    <div class="padding10top padding10left">
						    	<p><span><a name="cont_levels" id="cont_levels"></a><span class="strong">Part I, Levels:</span></span> <span><u>No teacher may earn more than three times their original award</u> at any point during the distribution of contingency funds. The leftover funds will be distributed proportionately to each Level based upon the award amounts originally assigned to that Level, as follows:</span></p>
						    	<ul>
						    		<li><span>Level 1 – 50% of remaining funds will be equally distributed to teachers that met Level 1.</span></li>
						    		<li><span>Level 2 – 25% of remaining funds will be equally distributed to teachers that met Level 2.</span></li>
						    		<li><span>Level 3 – 25% of remaining funds will be equally distributed to teachers that met Level 3.</span></li>
						    	</ul>
						    	<p><span><span class="strong"><span>Note:</span></span> This plan both differentiates by level and adds a requirement that no teacher may earn more than three times their original award amount earned.. This allows teachers to receive additional funds, but in proportion to the degree that they were earned.</span></p>
						    	<p><span><span class="strong"><a name="cont_group" id="cont_group"></a>Part I, Group and Individual:</span></span> Unearned award funds will be distributed proportionally according to the amount unearned within the grade level and individual awards.</p>
						    	<p>All unearned funds originally allocated to the grade level awards will be redistributed equally to teachers who earned a grade level award. The maximum award amount that a teacher can receive from a grade level award may not exceed $__,000.</p>
						    	<p>All unearned funds originally allocated to individual achievement awards will be redistributed equally to all teachers who earned an individual award. No teacher may receive more than two times their original award.</p>
						    	<p>The maximum award amount a classroom teacher can earn under Part I is $_,000.</p>
						    	<p><span class="strong">Note:</span> This plan maintains the integrity of the group and individual level awards. It continues to separate group success from individual success, preserving the objectives for having both types of rewards.</p>
						    	<p><span class="strong"><a name="cont_team" id="cont_group2"></a>Part II, Team Teaching &amp; Tutoring:</span> Unearned Part II award funds will be distributed in proportion to the amount unearned funds within the awards for tutoring and team teaching.</p>
						    	<p>All unearned funds originally allocated to the team teaching awards will be redistributed equally to teachers who earned a team teaching award. The maximum award amount that a teacher can receive from a grade level award may not exceed two times their original awards amount.</p>
						    	<p>All unearned funds originally allocated to the tutoring awards will be redistributed equally to teachers who earned a tutoring award. The maximum award amount that a teacher can receive from a tutoring award may not exceed two times their original awards amount.</p>
						    	<p>After redistribution, money left over will be applied to professional development and to pay substitute teachers in order to release teachers to attend professional development.</p>
						    	<p><span class="strong">Note:</span> The proportions are maintained between the two types of Part II awards, team teaching and tutoring. The awards are capped and remaining funds go to professional development as well as paying for substitutes to enable teachers to go on professional development.</p>

						    <div class="navtable"><a href="#cont_top">Return to Top of Page</a></div>
						
						    <p><span class="strong"><a name="cont_partii" id="cont_partii"></a>Mistake:</span><span class="strong">Part II funds that merely redistribute funds among those who earned an award in Part II.</span></p>
						    <p><span class="strong">Solution: Consider using Part II funds for other activities that support teaching and learning like professional development, paying for substitutes to provide teacher release time, providing stipends for mentors or instructional coaches, or building data capacity.</span></p>
						    <p><span>Explanation</span>: Part II affords the most flexibility for a district to invest in support structures for teachers. If money is unearned, it suggests that the staff could benefit from additional supports to help reach performance targets in the future.</p>
						    <p><span><span class="strong">Sample Language:</span></span> <span class="strong">This model covers professional development.</span></p>
						
						    <div class="padding10top padding10left">
						    	<p><span><span class="strong">Part II:</span></span> All unearned Part II funds to pay for professional development activities directly related to improving instruction and to pay for substitutes to allow for teacher release time to attend professional development activities. The Principal, Assistant Principal, and at least four teachers will determine the professional development needs and programming options.</p>
						    	<p><span><span class="strong">Note:</span></span> This language not only directs funds to professional development, but includes multiple campus stakeholders to ensure that the resources are directed towards staff needs. It also pays for substitutes to allow more teachers to attend professional development.</p>
						    	<p>Additionally, If your original D.A.T.E. plan invested less than 40% in Part II, unearned Part I funds can also be reallocated to Part II and spent on allowable activities <span class="strong">as long as at least 60% of</span> <span class="strong">total grant funds remain in Part I.</span></p>
						    	<p>For example, if your district allocated 80% of total grant funds to Part I and 10% of funds remain after Part I awards are distributed, that 10% can be moved to Part II to pay for other allowable activities.</p>
