               		<h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
                   <p>Since the creation of <a href="#">D.A.T.E.</a> in 2006, Texas has spent nearly $550 million to allow districts to design their own strategic compensation programs, or implement the <a href="">TAP System</a>.  This is the largest state-level strategic compensation program in the United States.</p>
				   <p>For the 2010-2011 school year, over 300 districts will be implementing a program. The districts represent over half of Texas' student and teacher population.</p>
				   <p>One of the unique aspects of D.A.T.E. is legislative-mandated state level technical assistance.  Run by the <a href="">Institute for Public School Initiatives (IPSI)</a> at <a href="">The University of Texas-Austin</a>, <a href="">Techical Assistance</a> staff members have maintained a call center, website, and have traveled throughout Texas to provide Texas districts comprehensive support on every aspect of D.A.T.E. program design and implementation.</p>

						<h3>A Strategic Compensation Partner for Texas Schools</h3>
						<p>Although strategic compensation reform has grown in popularity, there are still relatively few examples of successful strategic compensation awards programs. The Texas Legislature recognized the novelty and complexity of this reform and mandated technical assistance when it authorized the D.A.T.E. grant in 2006.</p>
						<p>The mission of the D.A.T.E. Technical Assistance Center, operated by the Institute for Public School Initiatives at The University of Texas-Austin, is to help districts use their grant as part of a holistic effort to recruit, retain, and develop high-quality educators throughout the state of Texas.</p>
						<h3>Technical Assistance Services</h3>
						<p>The Technical Assistance Center offers the following services:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="strong">Call Center:</span> Technical Assistance staff members are available by phone Monday through Friday at 512-232-2255</li>
							<li><span class="strong">Workshops & Training:</span> The staff has partnered with the 20 Regional Service Centers to offer highly interactive workshops and trainings on D.A.T.E. design and implementation. For a list of upcoming events, <a href="#">click here</a>.</li>
							<li><span class="strong">Program Consultations:</span> Technical assistance staff members will travel to any district who requests one-on-one support with its D.A.T.E. planning committee.</li>
							<li><span class="strong">Research Conferences:</span> In order to better educate districts, Technical Assistance has sponsored multiple conferences, assembling experts from around the nation on the latest in this important reform.</li>
							<li><span class="strong">Comprehensive Website:</span> This website contains a myriad of resources pertaining to D.A.T.E. including: all the materials from our previous workshops, model programs, a performance measure database, timely research and policy briefs, and videos from our earlier events.</li>

					<p class="lesssmalltext"><a href="#1" class="xtrig" rel="coda-slider-1">Back</a></p>					
						<h3>About D.A.T.E.</h3>
						<p>In 2006, Texas Legislature passed House Bill One creating the District Awards for Teacher Excellence (D.A.T.E.) grant.  It is a non-competitive grant, with nearly $550 million in funding for districts to design and implement a strategic compensation program.  Over 300 districts chose to be part of either Cycle 1, which began implementation in 2008-2009 or Cycle 2, which started implementation in 2010-2011.</p>
						<p>These districts represent over half of Texas teacher and student population and:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>56.5% of Texas’ total Hispanic student population</li>
							<li>64.6% of Texas’ African American population</li>
							<li>65.8% of Texas’ economically disadvantaged students</li>
							<li>60.2% of Texas’ special education population</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Structure of the Grant</h3>
						<p>D.A.T.E. requires districts to develop and implement an award plan either district-wide or with a selection of participating campuses.  Grant awards are divided into two parts.  Part I funds make up at least 60 percent of the grant award and must be used to award classroom teachers or principals who are the most effective at improving student performance in Texas school districts and who meet the Texas Education Code (TEC) definition of a classroom teacher.  Part II funds, up to 40 percent of the grant award, can be used on teacher stipends, teacher mentors, principal incentives, awards to other campus employees, professional development, or improvements to data capacity.</p>
						<p>Districts may design their own program or use funds to implement the TAP System.  Additionally, districts can choose to implement a district-wide program, or target high needs campuses.</p>
						<p>Funding is intended to support the establishment of district award programs encourage the recruitment, retention and development of high quality educators through:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Awarding teachers for positively impacting student achievement</li>
							<li>Creating capacity and sustainability for improved instruction within the district</li>
							<li>Alignment with overall district goals</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>About TAP System</h3>
						<p>TAP is a comprehensive research-based reform model that provides differentiated compensation for teachers and principals based on teachers' performance in the classroom and the academic performance of their students.  TAP balances a rigorous accountability system with strong support for teachers and school leaders.  The program provides career advancement opportunities for teachers--including differentiated salary augmentations for increased responsibilities and duties--and time for ongoing applied professional growth during the school day.</p>
						<p>Developed in 1998 by researchers at the Milken Family Foundation, the Teacher Advancement Program is administered through the National Institute for Excellence in Teaching (NIET) at the national level and through the University of Texas System at the state level in Texas.  The core elements of TAP are supported by a rich body of scientific research as well as practice in the field.  Further, the TAP process is consistent with successful business models, which emphasize the importance of incentives, accountability, on-the-job support and career paths in order to motivate and develop effective employees.  The TAP process, currently used at more than 125 U.S. schools, impacting more than 56,000 students and 3,500 teachers, is showing remarkable promise as reported in a recent study conducted by NIET.</p>
						<p>TAP is dedicated to attracting, developing, motivating and retaining high-caliber educators in order to raise achievement levels for all students.  To reach this goal, TAP provides incentives for career advancement, ongoing professional development, instructionally focused accountability, and performance pay - all of which are intended to maximize effective teaching.  The TAP program seeks to create an environment where both teachers and students excel, where teachers and principals work together to improve instructional practice, and where teachers and principals are rewarded for success.</p>
